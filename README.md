# 8-2-Journal-Portfolio-Submission

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?

The requirements of the goal was basically to create a program that had courses that allowed the user to pick up to 9 credits. Each course were 3 credits each, the user was also  not allowed to pick any of the same courses.
The application was designed to address students that needed to sign up for courses, the purpose is so that the students can sign up digitally.

What did you do particularly well in developing this application?

I did particularly well in figuring out how to solve the problems that the application faced. It did not take me long thinking of what to do to make the program run according to the goal.

Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Comparing the Console and the WPF, the WPF was way more intuative and did not really need a tutorial to understand how to use it. The console is not a good user experience at all because the user has to type specific things and if they messed up could lead to them having an error. The WPF was straight forward and gave necessary errors preventing the users from making silly mistakes such as having multiple of the same course. Overall the WPF's user experience is the best.

How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

I always approach the process of debugging and coding my applications with programming a console write and testing if functionality would work through that and eventually remove them for the actual functionality. If there is a problem I run into such as a loop not working when it is intended to, I use console outputs as indications why it fails. This in my opinion is my favorite strategy and I can foresee myself using it in the future.

Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

I had to be innovative with coming up with the methods create an error to the user about whether they tried to input the same course or not. I can see many different ways to implement this system. I can also see many different ways to implement the maximum credit limit.
